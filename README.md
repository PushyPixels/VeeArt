The Virtual Arts

* Make a Logic editor sytem for Unity (runtime)
* Make a Recorder System (to record all future dev sessions, including making Voxel Editor)
	iRecordable interface?
Make a Voxel editor system for Unity (runtime)
Make a simple game with the Voxel editor/Logic editor
Make a Patreon for project (educational content/game Universe) and advertise Unity back-bridge
	(Bring the games you make in the editor into Unity; ready to publish.)
Sell Epic on porting back bridge (and thus game) to Unreal
Use Epic money to port to GoDot (Or other appropriate open source option)
	Or build from scratch?
Meanwhile, open source the game Universe so community can improve and extend the featureset
	Organize and open source the localization effort too
	Neither should require a computer

Longterm:
	Polygon editors and PBR texture editors
	2d system too?  (Or 2.5d)
	webvr standalone capability viable?
